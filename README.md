# Introduction
My name is Ahmet Gyger, I'm a Program Manager at Microsoft, working in the team that build Azure Machine Learning. I have been approached by a few publication to write a book about our product but I don't have enough time to contribute alone on this journey. My hope is to have enough people, from Microsoft and outside, pitching in, to create a great book allowing data scientist to augment the scale at which they do Machine Learning and AI. 

This book is not a Microsoft produced book, as a results no technical writer are reviewing it's content. You can expect some mistakes on the technical front as well as the grammatical one. However, it's a public repository, so you should feel free to contribute as you like. 

# Azure Machine Learning Book
This book purpose is to offer a companion to Azure Machine Learning, focusing on the new services (still in preview at the time of writing) and the workbench. We will cover the fundamentals of the experimentation and operationalization services in Azure Machine Learning (abbreviated to AML further in this book.)

# What is covered? 
In the first chapter, we will setup you up for success, installing the workbench and creating the accounts necessary in Azure. We will then explore in depth the three main part of Azure Machine Learning, the data preparation tool, the experimentation services, and the model management services. We will then explore numerous examples, using many different technologies like TensorFlow, PyTorch, CNTK, ...
