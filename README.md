# Introduction
My name is Ahmet Gyger, I'm a Program Manager at Microsoft, working in the team that build Azure Machine Learning. I have been approached by a few publications to write a book about our product but I don't have enough time to contribute alone on this journey. My hope is to have enough people, from Microsoft and outside, pitching in, to create a great book allowing data scientist to augment the scale at which they do Machine Learning and AI. 

This book is not a Microsoft produced book, as a results no technical writer are reviewing it's content. You can (and should) expect some mistakes on the technical front as well as the grammatical one. However, it's a public repository, so you should feel free to contribute as you like. 

# Azure Machine Learning Book 
This book purpose is to offer a companion to Azure Machine Learning, focusing on the new services, the workbench, and the IDE extensions. We will cover the fundamentals of the experimentation and operationalization services in Azure Machine Learning (aka AML.)

# Where else can I get some information? 
If you can't wait for the book to be completed (which I totally understand), heads-up to our [Azure Machine Learning Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview) site. We spent a lot of time making that one great (and it's at Microsoft quality standard!) 

# What is covered? 
In the first chapter, we will setup you up for success, installing the workbench and creating the accounts necessary in Azure. We will then explore in depth the three main part of Azure Machine Learning, the data preparation tool, the experimentation services, and the model management services. We will then explore numerous examples, using many different technologies like TensorFlow, PyTorch, CNTK, ... 

# What is Azure Machine Learning Services and Workbench? 
Azure Machine learning has two distinct offering, the first one [**studio**](https://studio.azureml.net) which is a graphical interface to build prediction services. You can think about it as the simplest way to do machine learning. This is our the oldest product in the Azure Machine Learning family and is not covered in this book.  

The newest (the preview was publicly released in September 2017) is Azure Machine Learning Services and Workbench. The services are a set of cloud functionalities helping in the data science life cycle. One service help tracking the different evaluation metrics per iterations in your project, another service helps scaling horizontally and vertically, another one helps making reproducible experiment, there is also a service to build docker images out of your trained model, and a set of services building a serving endpoint to generate prediction at planet scale.
