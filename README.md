# Azure Machine Learning Book
This book purpose is to offer a companion to Azure Machine Learning, focusing on the new services (still in preview at the time of writing) and the workbench. We will cover the fundamentals of the experimentation and operationalization services in Azure Machine Learning (abbreviated to AML further in this book.)
